Set up backend
    -set up all routes
        -test everything using postman

    1. serve simple react app 
    2. routes
        a) google book search
            * GET
            * /search
            * use axios to make request
            * does not interact with mongodb
        b) save button
            * POST 
            * /save book 
            * summary, image, book name, author
        c) saved 
            * the html page (react component)
            * retreive all saved books (find all)
        d) delete button
            * / delete book 

Front end
    using react router:
        -/
            * onClick event on the search that makes axios call
        -/save 
            * componentDidMount

    I MAY HAVE INSTALLED REACT-ROUTER-DOM INTO THE WRONG FOLDER

            
    try to hit google search route from front end

    2. send param back

    ###Class example for forms
        make component smart to listen for input change
